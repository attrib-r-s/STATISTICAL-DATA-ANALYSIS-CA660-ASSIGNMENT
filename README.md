STATISTICAL DATA ANALYSIS CA660

ASSIGNMENT




Instructions: 

Produce a single report, with the name(s) and ID(s) clearly indicated on the top sheet. 
Group Assignment (2 in a group). One submission per group is required. 

Report Length:  

The aim is to provide a report, describing a good exploratory analysis, addressing the key questions that the data pose; the objectives should be to describe methods and solutions and to draw conclusions in a clear and concise way. The report should be structured in IEEE format and should not be expected to exceed 5 double-column pages of length, inclusive of any analysis reported in detail, background references or (short) code. Detailed code or listing of software commands should not be necessary, but students must indicate when they have used or adapted available code and where they have drawn on previously available analysis or sought to extend these. Since these are publicly available data, it would be unrealistic to expect that no-one has looked at them before! If further details are necessary to make a point, this should be indicated clearly in the text and the relevant appendix cited. One of the three topics presented should be selected. Your paper should have a clear structure: 
 
Chosen Option - 2.Various/Business/Finance

Similar to a previous project, but considerable updated information is now online. A wealth of information on daily stock prices and key indices is available on the web, offering information on e.g. mapping major series movements, - see e.g.  amongst others.

Several of these are regarded as benchmark indices, to which considerable attention is paid in terms of assessing global stock market activity and overall market stability, under the influence of major events, such as September 11th 2001 or contagion, e.g. the European sovereign debt crisis. In general, historical data are freely available, although more immediate information, unsurprisingly, has a price. So, one question might be just how useful some of these indicators are in terms of analysing the dynamics of change and providing predictive potential?

In the Eurozone and elsewhere, market behaviour is closely monitored. Major movements can be illustrated by plotting the financial series, by comparison and by some form of projection. Does this tell us enough about what drives the dynamics? For example, what are the sectoral features, what characterizes drawdowns and drawups, how important are the time-windows considered?  The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 is a stock index of Eurozone equities, designed to provide a blue-chip representation of super sector leaders in the Eurozone; 
For comparison, if required, the equities of standard & Poors (S&P) 500 have full price data available for a period of years. There are also other possibilities.

Thus, the project involves identification of data sources, data retrieval and processing, with the aim of analysing market dynamics and assessing prediction potential. Assessment is needed of the approach used and robustness of the analysis. Identify key questions of interest, quality and reliability of the data and their appropriateness to answer these key questions. Your report should provide a clear statement of what you set out to do and why, indicate the completeness of the data and a brief description and results of the various stages. State your conclusions clearly and indicate limitations and suggestions for future work; (see example points first option).
 
Key references should be included, particularly where these have been heavily drawn upon.
